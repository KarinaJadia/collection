            <p>
            Hello! Welcome to this fun little site I made! I was inspired by my latest Cybersecurity lab 
            (where we had to do some basic HTML coding to make a fake phishing website) to create a 
            website that could do some basic calculations, ripped directly from the calculators I already
            have made in my GitHub.
            <br><br>
            I had already made the decimal-binary code, GFC code, and a few other calculators (that I might
            add later) in Python (on my GitHub if you want to go check them out) because to me it was easier
            to make some tiny little code do some of my homework for me and it was easier to press a button
            in VS Code than google 'binary to decimal' every time. And this website makes it even quicker 
            for me!
